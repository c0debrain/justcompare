compare.sql was created from the database using this (provided here in the hope that it would be helpful for someone trying to restore it):

pg_dump -C -c  -f compare.sql -F c -O compare

compare_simple.sql was created using:

pg_dump -f compare_simple.sql compare

Also, please note that these dumps are from data which was scraped around June 2013. So it is dated.
